# MacOS apps I find awesome 
#### and would instal on any Mac I have. Ordered by must-have-ness (kind of).

1. [AppGrid Launcher](https://appgridmac.com/) - LaunchPad for MacOS 26. Free version is quite fine
2. [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) - window management without pain (I still don't like MacOS default implementation of this feature)
3. [LinearMouse](https://github.com/linearmouse/linearmouse) - set scrolling direction, disable pointer acceleration - all of it per-device
4. [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) - delete apps from your mac completely
5. [HiddenBar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden) - declutter your menubar 
6. [ICE](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) - alternative menu bar declutter since Bartender has bad reviews lately (use beta-version for MacOS 26, if release one doesn't work)
7. [CheatSheet](https://cheatsheet-mac.en.softonic.com/mac) - hold control button for 2 sec and get list of hotkeys for focused app
8. [Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/blob/master/README.md) - clipboard manager
9. [Fork](https://git-fork.com) - git client
10. [TinkerTool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) - tweak different MacOS settings: disable Dock animations, add 'quit' to Finder, etc.
11. [Latest](https://github.com/mangerlahn/Latest) - get latest versions of your apps
12. [IINA](https://iina.io) - video player that doesn't suck
13. [MonitorControl](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl) - control external monitor volume and brightness levels - as if it was a native Apple display
14. [NotchNook](https://lo.cafe/notchnook) - fun app that make the notch on your macbook less dumb: adds music player (spotify/apple music) and calendar with events. **Payment required**
15. [EthernetStatus](https://ethernetstatus.com) - well, it shows your ethernet connection status, if you prefer to use ethernet cable instead of wi-fi
16. [Transmission](https://github.com/transmission/transmission) - torrent client of choice
17. [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app) - Wine + Apple Game Porting Toolkit, a.k.a. "Windows games on MacOS". Tried with Steam + GTA5 - it's fine.
18. [Pinta](https://www.pinta-project.com) - closest alternative for Paint.NET for MacOS I found (new version is buggy, use pre-redesign one)
19. [Blackmagic Disc Speed Test](https://apps.apple.com/kz/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12) - well, it let you check your disc read/write speed
20. AdBlock Plus - you know what it is
